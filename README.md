# pufferpanel-themes
A collection of themes for the PufferPanel software. All of these are currently v2 themes, with plans to upgrade to v3 once it is stable.

## Build themes
If you would like to build the themes from source, follow these directions:
1. Run the `./build_themes.sh` script.
2. Go to the `output/` folder and find the theme you want!
